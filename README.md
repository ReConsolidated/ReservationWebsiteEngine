# Reservation Website Engine, formerly known as "ZPIBackend"

Project built for engineering degree at University of Science and Technology in Wroc≈Çaw.

This is an API for a service allowing clients to setup their own reservations website. The project is fully functional, however it doesn't cover business cases, like collecting payments from clients.
The reservation websites are customizable and can cover various different cases, for example car rental, room reservation or even requesting a Mass intention.

The project has received the highest grade possible and wasn't pursued any further after graduation.
